       Rice, (Oryza sativa), edible starchy cereal grain and the grass plant (family Poaceae) by which it is produced. ... Rice is cooked by boiling, or it can be ground into a flour. It is eaten alone and in a great variety of soups, side dishes, and main dishes in Asian, Middle Eastern, and many other cuisines.Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa (Asian rice) or less commonly Oryza glaberrima (African rice). The name wild rice is usually used for species of the genera Zizania and Porteresia, both wild and domesticated, although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of Oryza.

        As a cereal grain, domesticated rice is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia and Africa. It is the agricultural commoditywith the third-highest world.Oct 19, 2020 · A Word From Verywell The R.I.C.E. treatment is recommended by health professionals for the early treatment of bone injury or acute soft tissue injuries such as a sprain or strain.
        
        It can be helpful for sports injuries, closed fractures, and degenerative joint problems.Boasting a 300-acre tree-lined campus in Houston, Rice University is ranked among the nation’s top 20 universities by U.S. News & World Report. Rice has a 6-to-1 undergraduate student-to-faculty ratio, and a residential college system, which supports students intellectually, emotionally and culturally through social events, intramural sports, student plays, lectures series, courses and student government.Rice is one of the most important commodities in the world and directly feeds more people than any other crop. Because of this, it is a staple food in many countries. However, what else is there to know about this wonder crop? See for yourself with these rice facts.Brown rice is a popular choice for people with dietary restrictions. Unlike white rice, brown rice retains the fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants found in whole grain, while white rice is stripped of these nutrients – providing “empty” calories.

        The domestication process was likely a very slow one, lasting between 7000 and 100 BCE. Chinse archaeologist Yongchao Ma and colleagues have identified three stages in the domestication process during which rice slowly changed eventually becoming a dominant part of local diets by about 2500 BCE. Changes from the original plant are recognized as the location of rice fields outside of perennial swamps and wetlands, and non-shattering rachis.

        Early evidence for the use of wild O. rufipogon has been identified at Shangshan and Jiahu, both of which contained ceramic vessels tempered with rice chaff, from contexts dated between 8000–7000 BCE. Direct dating of rice grains at two Yangtse river basin sites was reported by Chinese archaeologists led by Xinxin Zuo: Shangshan (9400 cal BP) and Hehuashan (9000 cal BP), or about 7,000 BCE. By about 5,000 BCE, domesticated japonica is found throughout the Yangtse valley, including large amounts of rice kernels at such sites as TongZian Luojiajiao (7100 BP) and Hemuda (7000 BP). By 6000–3500 BCE, rice and other Neolithic lifestyle changes were spread throughout southern China. Rice reached Southeast Asia into Vietnam and Thailand (Hoabinhian period) by 3000–2000 BCE.

        There are four regions that are currently considered possible loci of domestication in China: the middle Yangtze (Pengtoushan culture, including such sites as at Bashidang); the Huai River (including the Jiahu site) of southwest Henan province; the Houli culture of Shandong province; and the lower Yangtze River Valley. Most but not all scholars point to the lower Yangtze River as the likely origin location, which at the end of the Younger Dryas (between 9650 and 5000 BCE) was the northern edge of the range for O. rufipogon. Younger Dryas climatic changes in the region included the increase of local temperatures and summer monsoon rainfall amounts, and the inundation of much of the coastal regions of China as the sea rose an estimated 200 feet (60 meters).

        The archaeological record suggests that O. japonica arrived in the Indus Valley at least as early as 2400–2200 BCE, and became well-established in the Ganges River region beginning around 2000 BCE. However, by at least 2500 BCE, at the site of Senuwar, some rice cultivation, presumably of dryland O. nivara was underway. Additional evidence for the continuing interaction of China by 2000 BCE with Northwest India and Pakistan comes from the appearance of other crop introductions from China, including peach, apricot, broomcorn millet, and Cannabis. Longshan style harvest knives were made and used in the Kashmir and Swat regions after 2000 BCE.Nigeria, along with many countries across the world, has ecologies that are suitable for different rice varieties and that can be harnessed to boost rice production to meet domestic demands, and even to produce a surplus for export (Anonymous, 1997a). The country has a potential land area for rice production of between 4.6 million and 4.9 million ha. However, only 1.7 million ha, or 35 percent of Nigeria's total land mass, is cropped to rice. The cultivable land to rice is spread over five major ecologies - upland, inland or shallow swamp, irrigated rice, deep water or floating rice, and tidal mangrove or swamp. The latter is not fully developed because there is a lack of appropriate technology (Singh et al., 1997). In spite of the presence of suitable environments, however, Nigeria is not among the leading world rice producers. This article highlights problems that could help to explain the imbalance between rice production and consumption. It also suggests areas of improvement that would boost local rice production to meet domestic demand.
